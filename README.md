# binary_prop_matrix
Calculates which of a long list of binary explanatory variables are most relevant when explaining the difference between two binary dependent variables.   [For example, if you want to know which of 100 binary variables (e.g. rent vs. own home, age 65+ vs. not) are most relevant for explaining the difference between cigarette users &amp; e-cigarette users.]
